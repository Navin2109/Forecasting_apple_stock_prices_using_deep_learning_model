# Forecasting_apple_stock_prices_using_deep_learning_model
Developed an LSTM-based deep learning model to forecast Apple stock prices over a 30-day horizon using 5 years of historical data from the Tiingo API. Leveraged NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow for data preprocessing and modeling, with Matplotlib for visualization. The project demonstrates time series forecasting with Keras.
